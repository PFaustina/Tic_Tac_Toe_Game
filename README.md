This is a Rock Paper Scissors game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Techologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

# Approach Taken

This game is designed to allow a user to play against the computer by selecting one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will randomly choose its move, and the game determines the winner based on the following rules:

Rock beats scissors.
Paper covers rock.
Scissors cut paper.

# unsolved problems

One of the challenges in the game I am currently having is the inability to add a scoring system that spans multiple rounds. As a result, each game is limited to a single round.
